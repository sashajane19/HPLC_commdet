# HPLC_commdet
This code was created to find communities of phytoplankton pigments (measured with High Performance Liquid Chromatography [HPLC]) using network-based community detection methods.

All code and data in this repository are freely available for use by anyone for any and all applications. If you use this code, we ask that you please cite the following paper where these methods were used:
